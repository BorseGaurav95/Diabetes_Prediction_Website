        <b><h3><u>Glucose:-</u></h3></b>
        <p>
Our blood glucose level, or blood sugar level, is the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. The amount of glucose in the blood is measured in millimoles per litre (mmol/l). Glucose levels are measured most commonly to diagnose or to monitor diabetes. It is also important to keep an eye on blood glucose levels during certain situations – for example: during pregnancy, pancreatitis and with increasing age. Normally, blood sugar 
levels stay within a narrow range during the day. A good level is between 4 to 8mmol/l. After you consume food, your blood sugar level will rise and after you have had a night’s rest, they will usually be lowest in the morning
            
        </p>  
<b><h3><u>Insulin:-</u></h3></b>        
<p>

Insulin is important because it helps control your blood sugar (glucose) level, so your body gets the energy it needs for daily activities. When the amount of glucose in the blood rises to a certain level, the 
pancreas will release more insulin to push more glucose into the cells. This causes the glucose levels in the blood (blood glucose levels) to drop.
        </p>
        <b><h3><u>Blood pressure:-</u></h3></b>
<p>        

In individuals with diabetes mellitus, higher risk for renal and cardiovascular disease is seen with blood pressure levels >130/80 mm Hg. Findings of several studies, as well as new guidelines, indicate that individuals with diabetes will benefit from more aggressive treatment of hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and calcium-channel blockers are effective antihypertensive agents in type 2 diabetes. Moreover, combinations of these agents are frequently required to reach the target blood pressure of (130/80) mm Hg and reduce risk for renal and cardiovascular events. All of these agents have demonstrated benefits in treating patients. Clinical evidence also indicates that the new vasodilating beta-bloc
kers offer advantages beyond blood pressure control, including cardiovascular risk reduction without exacerbating metabolic parameters. Wi
th increased awareness of the need for aggressive treatment of hypertension, clinicians can provide significant benefit to t
heir patients with diabetes. The new beta-blockers may play an important role in achieving blood pressure goals
